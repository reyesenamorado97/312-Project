License Description:

MIT License:
This is known as one of the simplest open source license agreements. The MIT License will allow permission for users to 
reuse code under this license for the use of any purpose, this is true in some cases where the code involved is included in 
a portion of proprietary software. The requirement of programmer that may want to use and modify code under this license is 
that they include the original copy of the MIT license in their description. A benefit of this license is that it can be 
used by developers who intend to create programs for personal or propriety use, and that they are able to modify and 
distribute as they wish. This is assuming that developers include the full copyright and license text.

Apache 2.0 License:
This license is very similar to the MIT License described above, since it allows developers to modify and distribute code 
that is under the Apache 2.0 license for commercial and private use. Additionally, it allows for sublicensing, meaning that 
it is possible to extend the license to the software. It includes the ability to place a warranty on the software that is 
licensed and it can use patent claims of contributors to the code. To use code under this license, developers must include 
the copyright statement and license text (which is also true in the case of the MIT License). Additionally, they must also include a notice file with attribution notes included and state any significant changes that were made to the software.

License Restrictions:

MIT License:
A restriction that this license has is that it cannot hold the owner of the software/license liable for damages, which is a 
good restriction to have. Generally, it is known that the MIT License is the least restrictive amongst the other licenses.

Apache 2.0 License:
Similarly to the MIT License, a restriction of this license is liability. Additionally, it is forbidden to use any of the contributors' names, trademarks or logos.
